# Flying-Ball


This is a mobile based game created using Unity version : 2019.2.0f1 /n
This game a slingshot mechanism that i implemented and every time you touch the screen and pull it to a side, depending on how much you pulled and the angle you pulled in, the ball will go to the opposite with a force linear to how much you pulled, just like a real life slingshot, which makes a pretty interesting games, with proper level management, i believe it can be very successful
